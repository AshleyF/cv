My 15 years at Microsoft were an amazing and rather diverse experience; a dozen teams in several divisions shipping products and transitioning research to product groups. This includes shipping Bing v1, Local Search v1, Windows Mobile (years before the iPhone), Live Search for Mobile, Azure Mobile Services, OneApp, MSN publishing platform and others including extreemely interesting projects that have not been made public. Prior to Microsoft I worked on tools for database management at Intel. Before this, I was employee #2 at an Internet Startup company (1994) and also did automation work for paper publishing companies including Capital Cities/ABC publishing and the Moscow-Pullman Daily News.

On the robotics team I implemented program synthesis for learning by demonstration and a 3D manipulation UI and simulator. We published this work and I presented our paper at iROS 2014. I also implemented path planning and tracking for the navigation stack and before that I worked on HRI for "Max". I even did firmware for microcontrollers at one point, including writing our own Forth and .NET JIT compiler. Again, very diverse experience even within robotics.

Since leaving Microsoft I have founded Brief Robotics and been working with partners on several incubation projects.
